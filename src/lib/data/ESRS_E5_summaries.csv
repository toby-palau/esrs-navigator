1,Objective,"This standard tells companies to share information about how they use resources and manage waste, aiming to use resources wisely and reduce environmental harm. It asks for details on the impact of their actions, efforts to reduce negative effects, plans to follow circular economy principles, risks and opportunities related to resource use, and financial impacts. The circular economy is about keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible to cut down on waste. The standard is based on EU laws and the goal of shifting from a throw-away society to one that recycles and reuses materials. Companies must report on the resources they use and the waste they produce.",,

9,Interactions with other ESRS,"Using resources carefully helps the environment by reducing climate change, pollution, and harm to water, oceans, and wildlife. A circular economy reuses resources to cut down on waste and save energy. This helps the air, water, and nature. Other rules (ESRS E1-E4) talk about climate, pollution, water, oceans, and animals. How companies use resources can also impact local people and is covered by ESRS S3. Being resource-smart is good for business and the economy. This information goes with general rules ESRS 1 and 2.",,
