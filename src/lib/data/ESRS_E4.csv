This includes operation sites and sourcing locations. Different range layers will have different levels of accuracy depending on certain factors (e.g., whether species ranges have been refined based on availability of habitat). Information on the threat status of the species, and the activities that threaten them, can provide an indication of the likely contribution that business activities may be having on driving population trends and threat status.\n (bii) At the ecosystem level, data layers reflecting change in the extent and condition of ecosystems can be applied, including levels of habitat fragmentation and connectivity.\n (c) modelled biodiversity state data: Model-based approaches are commonly used for measuring ecosystem level indicators (e.g., extent, condition, or function). Models quantify how the magnitude of different pressures affects the state of biodiversity. These are referred to as pressure-state relationships and are based on globally collected data. Modelling results are applied locally to estimate how undertaking level pressures will cause changes in ecosystem condition. An impact driver generally has three main characteristics: magnitude (e.g., amount of contaminant, noise intensity), spatial extent (e.g., area of land contaminated) and temporal extent (duration of persistence of contaminant).",,
