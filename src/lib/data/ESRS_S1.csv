2,Objective,,"In order to meet the objective, this Standard also requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on its own workforce in relation to the following social, including human rights, factors or matters:\n (a) working conditions, including:\n (ai) secure employment;\n (aii) working time;\n (aiii) adequate wages;\n (aiv) social dialogue;\n (av) freedom of association, the existence of works councils and the information, consultation and participation rights of workers;\n (avi) collective bargaining, including the rate of the undertaking’s workforce covered by collective agreements;\n (avii) work-life balance; and\n (aviii) health and safety.\n (b) equal treatment and opportunities for all, including:\n (bi) gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value;\n (bii) training and skills development;\n (biii) employment and inclusion of persons with disabilities\n (biv) measures against violence and harassment in the workplace; and\n (bv) diversity.\n (c) other work-related rights, including those that relate to:\n (ci) child labour;\n (cii) forced labour;\n (ciii) adequate housing; and\n (civ) privacy.",,
3,Objective,,"This Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on its own workforce, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking. For example, on the matter of equal opportunities, discrimination in hiring and promotion against women can reduce the undertaking’s access to qualified labour and harm its reputation. Conversely, policies to increase the representation of women in the workforce and in upper levels of management can have positive effects, such as increasing the pool of qualified labour and improving the undertaking’s reputation.",,
4,Objective,,"This Standard covers an undertaking’s own workforce, which is understood to include both people who are in an employment relationship with the undertaking (“employees”) and nonemployees who are either people with contracts with the undertaking to supply labour (“self employed people”) or people provided by undertakings primarily engaged in “employment activities” (NACE Code N78).

AR6,"Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model",Application Requirements,"Impacts on the undertaking’s own workforce can originate in its strategy or business model in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking’s value proposition (such as providing lowest cost products or services, or high-speed delivery, in ways that put pressure on labour rights in its own operations), or its cost structure and the revenue model (such as shifting inventory risk to suppliers, with knock-on effects on the labour rights of people who work for them).",,
AR7,"Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model",Application Requirements,"Impacts on the undertaking’s own workforce that originate in the strategy or business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, risks arise if some people in the workforce are at risk of forced labour, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour. An example of opportunities for the undertaking may result from providing opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling in the context of a “just transition”. Another example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, relates to the undertaking potentially relying on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefits that may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major supply chain breakdowns. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of lowskilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections for them are also increasing with media backlash and consumer preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.",,
AR8,"Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model",Application Requirements,"Examples of particular characteristics of people in the undertaking’s own workforce that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 15 relate to young people that may be more susceptible to impacts on their physical and mental development, or women in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrants in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some people in the 19 workforce, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to undertake may put them at risk (for example, people required to handle chemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid employees who are on “zero hours” contracts).",,
AR9,"Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model",Application Requirements,"With regard to paragraph 16, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking’s dependency on its own workforce where low-likelihood but high-impact events may trigger financial effects; for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe health impacts on the undertaking’s workforce resulting in major disruptions to production and distribution. Other examples of risk related to the undertaking’s dependency on its workforce include a shortage in skilled workers or political decisions or legislation affecting its own operations and own workforce.",,

AR7,Appendix A: Application Requirements,"Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model","Impacts on the undertaking’s own workforce that originate in the strategy or business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, risks arise if some people in the workforce are at risk of forced labour, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour. An example of opportunities for the undertaking may result from providing opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling in the context of a “just transition”. Another example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, relates to the undertaking potentially relying on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefits that may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major supply chain breakdowns.

An example of such a reason is the recruitment of employees to undertake work on a temporary or seasonal project or event. Another example is the standard practice of offering a temporary contract (for example, six months) to new employees before an offer of permanent employment is made. The undertaking may also explain the reasons for nonguaranteed hours employment.",,
