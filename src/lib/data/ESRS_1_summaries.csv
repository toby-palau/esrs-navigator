Objective,"The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) mandates organizations to disclose relevant environmental, social, and governance information, shaping the understanding of their impact on society and the environment, while adhering to the EU's amended directives.",,
"Categories of ESRS Standards, reporting areas and drafting conventions","There are three types of standards for reporting sustainability: general standards for all companies, specific standards for certain topics, and standards for particular industries. General standards explain how to report, while topic standards give details on what to report for different sustainability issues, and industry standards focus on what's important for specific sectors. Companies must report on governance, strategy, impact, risk, and targets, and if something important isn't covered by these standards, they should provide extra information. The standards use clear terms and have rules for what companies must or can report.",,
Qualitative characteristics of information,"Companies should make their sustainability reports relevant and accurate, ensuring the information is useful, unbiased, and complete. They should also make their reports easy to compare with others, check for accuracy, and write them clearly and concisely.",,
Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures,,"Report on sustainability using the double materiality principle | Identify stakeholders affected by the company's actions | Engage with stakeholders for due diligence and to assess sustainability impact | Perform materiality assessments to decide what sustainability information to report | Always disclose required general information, even if a matter isn't deemed material | Provide detailed explanations if excluding certain sustainability disclosures | Include policies, actions, and targets for material sustainability matters | Disclose metrics for material sustainability matters, omitting non-material data | Establish criteria for what sustainability information to disclose | Consider both impact and financial materiality in assessments | Identify and assess impacts, risks, and opportunities in the value chain | Consider dependencies on natural, human, and social resources | Report on principal impacts, risks, and opportunities | Use thresholds to determine materiality for reporting | Disaggregate reported information when necessary for clarity | Engage with stakeholders for input on material impacts, risks, and opportunities | Assess severity of impacts based on scale, scope, and irremediability | Consider risks and opportunities as sources of financial effects | Determine materiality based on likelihood and potential financial impact | Use the list of sustainability matters in topical ESRS to support materiality assessment | Develop entity-specific disclosures for material matters not covered by ESRS.",
Due diligence,"Companies use a process called due diligence to understand and improve how their business affects people and the environment. This process doesn't change how company leaders do their jobs, but it helps them see where they can make better decisions about risks and opportunities. International rules guide companies on how to do this step by step, focusing on the most serious issues first. The process is ongoing and can change how a company works. Specific rules called ESRS tell companies how to share information about their efforts in different areas, like how they make decisions, talk to people affected by their business, find and fix problems, and check if their solutions are working.",,
Value chain,,"Align the sustainability report with the financial report. | Report impacts from the entire supply chain.Only cover important parts of the supply chain. | Add data that helps understand sustainability impact. | Use double materiality to identify key sustainability issues. | Report on associated companies and joint ventures. | Use estimates when exact data is unavailable. | Include supply chain info related to company policies. | Use averages or similar data when specific data is not available. | Estimate using the best available, affordable data.",
Time horizons,"Companies should match their sustainability report timing with their financial report timing and link past and future sustainability information. They should compare new data with a chosen base year and show progress towards goals. Sustainability reports should cover short-term (same as financial reports), medium-term (up to 5 years), and long-term (over 5 years) periods, with extra details if needed. If industry-specific factors require, companies can use different time frames for medium and long-term reporting.",,
Preparation and presentation of sustainability information,,"Disclose previous period data for all quantitative metrics and narratives | Explain any differences in comparative information from previous periods | Disclose when it's impractical to adjust prior period data | Follow specific ESRS requirements for presenting multiple comparative periods | Disclose significant uncertainties in quantitative metrics and monetary amounts | Ensure data and assumptions align with financial statements | Disclose potential impacts of future events based on materiality criteria | Consider cumulative material risk from aggregated low-probability events | Reflect significant post-period events in the report | Maintain metric calculation consistency over time and disclose changes | Restate prior period errors unless impractical | Assess material impacts for the entire group, including subsidiaries | Describe significant differences in risks or opportunities between the group and subsidiaries | Omit classified or sensitive information while maintaining overall disclosure relevance | Include descriptive information on opportunities and consider their materiality.",
Structure of the sustainability statement,"Companies must include a clear sustainability report in their management reports, following EU rules. This report should be easy to read and find, both for people and computers. It must cover specific environmental, social, and governance information, and can also include other sustainability details if they are clearly marked and meet quality standards. Companies should organize their sustainability report into four main sections and can refer to other sections to avoid repeating information. They should also make sure any extra details they add are useful and reliable.",,
Linkages with other parts of corporate reporting and connected information,,"Explain how the sustainability report connects to other company reports | Include information from other reports by referencing sections like management, financials, or governance | Make sure referenced information is clear, published on time, in the same language, and meets quality and digital standards | Link the sustainability report to the company's environmental management report if it meets certain conditions | Ensure the sustainability report is easy to read and cohesive | Describe how different parts of the report relate to each other, like how the company's strategy affects finances and goals | Include references in the sustainability report to related financial statement sections for significant monetary or data points | Explain how data in the sustainability report relates to financial statements, possibly with a reconciliation table | Ensure consistency between the sustainability report and financial statements, and explain any inconsistencies | Follow additional sector-specific rules for data and assumption consistency if applicable.",
Transitional provisions,"Companies will gradually include more sustainability topics in their reports as new guidelines are developed, reducing the need for company-specific information. Initially, they can reuse past sustainability information and add extra details relevant to their industry. For the first three years, if a company doesn't have complete data about its supply chain, it should explain its efforts to get this information and future plans. Early on, companies can limit supply chain reporting to what they already know and what's public, especially to ease the burden on small businesses. After three years, they must report more supply chain details. Small businesses in the supply chain won't have to provide more information than what will be required of them in future guidelines. Companies don't need to compare current sustainability data with past data in their first report under the new standards. Some reporting requirements can be phased in and may not apply in the first year.",,
