Objective,"The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) are rules for companies to report how they affect the environment and society, and how these issues affect them, but companies don't have to report on things they don't find important.",,
"Categories of ESRS Standards, reporting areas and drafting conventions","There are three types of standards for reporting sustainability: general standards for all companies, specific standards for certain topics, and standards for particular industries. General standards explain how to report, while topic standards give details on what to report for different sustainability issues, and industry standards focus on what's important for specific sectors. Companies must report on governance, strategy, impact, risk, and targets, and if something important isn't covered by these standards, they should provide extra information. The standards use clear terms and have rules for what companies must or can report.",,
Qualitative characteristics of information,"When a company writes its report on how it's doing with sustainability, it should make sure the information is important, accurate, easy to compare with others, can be checked, and is clear to understand. The details of what these qualities mean are explained in a special section at the end of the rules.",,
Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures,,"Report on sustainability using the double materiality principle | Identify stakeholders affected by the company's actions | Engage with stakeholders for due diligence and to assess sustainability impact | Perform materiality assessments to decide what sustainability information to report | Always disclose required general information, even if a matter isn't deemed material | Provide detailed explanations if excluding certain sustainability disclosures | Include policies, actions, and targets for material sustainability matters | Disclose metrics for material sustainability matters, omitting non-material data | Establish criteria for what sustainability information to disclose | Consider both impact and financial materiality in assessments | Identify and assess impacts, risks, and opportunities in the value chain | Consider dependencies on natural, human, and social resources | Report on principal impacts, risks, and opportunities | Use thresholds to determine materiality for reporting | Disaggregate reported information when necessary for clarity | Engage with stakeholders for input on material impacts, risks, and opportunities | Assess severity of impacts based on scale, scope, and irremediability | Consider risks and opportunities as sources of financial effects | Determine materiality based on likelihood and potential financial impact | Use the list of sustainability matters in topical ESRS to support materiality assessment | Develop entity-specific disclosures for material matters not covered by ESRS.",
Due diligence,"Companies use a process called due diligence to understand and improve how their business affects people and the environment. This process doesn't change how company leaders do their jobs, but it helps them see where they can make better decisions about risks and opportunities. International rules guide companies on how to do this step by step, focusing on the most serious issues first. The process is ongoing and can change how a company works. Specific rules called ESRS tell companies how to share information about their efforts in different areas, like how they make decisions, talk to people affected by their business, find and fix problems, and check if their solutions are working.",,
Value chain,,"Write a sustainability report that matches your financial report | If you're a big company with smaller companies under you, the report should cover the whole group | Don't worry about this if you don't have to make financial reports or if you're already doing group sustainability reports under a specific law | Include in your report how your business, and the companies and people you work with, might affect or be affected by environmental and social issues | Focus on the most important effects and risks in your business and the companies you work with, both where you get things from and where your products go | You don't have to report on every single company you work with, just the important ones | Include this information when it helps people understand your sustainability or when it's needed to make your report good quality | Use a special way of figuring out what's important in sustainability, looking at both your impact and what matters to your business | If you work with other companies that you partly own, include them in your report in the same way you do for other companies you work with | Getting information from companies you work with can be hard, especially if you don't control them or if they're small | If you can't get the information after trying, you can use estimates based on average data for your industry or other similar information | When talking about your plans and goals, include how they involve the companies you work with | Sometimes you can use estimates, like average data, especially for environmental stuff, without needing info from every company you work with | Make sure any estimates you use still make your report good quality | If you can't get the info you need, use the best available information without too much trouble or cost, like data from indirect sources or market data.",
Time horizons,"Companies should match their sustainability report timing with their financial report timing and link past and future sustainability information. They should compare new data with a chosen base year and show progress towards goals. Sustainability reports should cover short-term (same as financial reports), medium-term (up to 5 years), and long-term (over 5 years) periods, with extra details if needed. If industry-specific factors require, companies can use different time frames for medium and long-term reporting.",,
Preparation and presentation of sustainability information,,"Read and understand the chapter on sustainability reporting | Present sustainability information clearly | Show how current numbers compare to previous ones | Explain any changes from past reports | If you can't match old data to new, say why | Follow specific rules if more than one past year is needed | Describe any uncertainties in your numbers | Use good guesses and scenarios when exact numbers aren't possible | Keep your sustainability info consistent with your financial info | Explain how future events might affect your numbers | Correct any past mistakes unless it's too hard | Make sure group-level reports cover all parts of the business | Don't share secret or sensitive info | If you leave out certain details, make sure your report still makes sense | Describe opportunities in a way that shows their importance and potential impact.",
Structure of the sustainability statement,"This chapter explains how companies should report their sustainability efforts in a clear section of their management report, following EU rules. Companies must clearly separate required sustainability information from other details and make it easy to read and understand. They should include all necessary sustainability disclosures and make sure any additional sustainability information they provide is clearly marked and meets quality standards. The report should be organized into four parts: general, environmental, social, and governance information, and avoid repeating information. Companies can add their own specific sustainability details as long as they are relevant and help users understand the company's impact and risks. When choosing what to include, companies should consider if the information is useful, accurate, and comparable to other companies or over time. The information should be clear, concise, and put together in a way that makes sense as a whole.",,
Linkages with other parts of corporate reporting and connected information,,"Explain how the sustainability report connects to other company reports | Include information from other reports by referencing sections like management, financials, or governance | Make sure referenced information is clear, published on time, in the same language, and meets quality and digital standards | Link the sustainability report to the company's environmental management report if it meets certain conditions | Ensure the sustainability report is easy to read and cohesive | Describe how different parts of the report relate to each other, like how the company's strategy affects finances and goals | Include references in the sustainability report to related financial statement sections for significant monetary or data points | Explain how data in the sustainability report relates to financial statements, possibly with a reconciliation table | Ensure consistency between the sustainability report and financial statements, and explain any inconsistencies | Follow additional sector-specific rules for data and assumption consistency if applicable.",
Transitional provisions,"Companies will gradually include more sustainability topics in their reports as new guidelines are developed, reducing the need for company-specific information. Initially, they can reuse past sustainability information and add extra details relevant to their industry. For the first three years, if a company doesn't have complete data about its supply chain, it should explain its efforts to get this information and future plans. Early on, companies can limit supply chain reporting to what they already know and what's public, especially to ease the burden on small businesses. After three years, they must report more supply chain details. Small businesses in the supply chain won't have to provide more information than what will be required of them in future guidelines. Companies don't need to compare current sustainability data with past data in their first report under the new standards. Some reporting requirements can be phased in and may not apply in the first year.",,
