Objective,"The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) help companies report on important sustainability issues. They focus on environmental, social, and governance topics. Companies don't have to report on issues they find unimportant. The aim is to make it clear how companies affect people and the environment. ESRS also guides how to prepare these reports.",,
"1. Categories of ESRS Standards, reporting areas and drafting conventions","The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) have three types: general, topic-specific, and industry-specific. They guide companies on reporting sustainability information. ESRS 1 explains how to use these standards. ESRS 2 lists what companies must report on key sustainability issues. The standards cover governance, strategy, impact, and targets. They also set rules for how to write and organize reports.",,
2. Qualitative characteristics of information,"Companies must ensure their sustainability statements are relevant, accurately represented, comparable, verifiable, and understandable. These qualities are detailed in Appendix B of the Standard.",,
3. Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures,"Organizations need to report following principles and procedures. It's important for them to consider both affected stakeholders and users of sustainability statements. Central to this process is the materiality assessment, which identifies impacts, risks, and opportunities relevant for sustainability reporting. Organizations are required to disclose information according to specific guidelines, including impacts on people and the environment. The assessment also involves considering both financial and impact materiality to identify material sustainability matters for reporting. Additionally, detailed procedures for disclosing information on policies, actions, and targets related to material sustainability matters are outlined, along with guidelines for aggregating and disaggregating data for clarity and accuracy in reporting.",,
4. Due diligence,"The undertaking must use its sustainability due diligence process to assess its material impacts, risks, and opportunities. This due diligence, aligning with international guidelines, involves identifying, preventing, and mitigating negative environmental and social impacts from its operations and value chain. The process is dynamic, influencing the undertaking's strategy and business model. Key elements of due diligence, such as governance, stakeholder engagement, impact assessment, action plans, and effectiveness tracking, are incorporated into the Disclosure Requirements of ESRS 2 and various topical ESRS standards.",,
5. Value chain,"The organization's sustainability statement must align with its financial reporting entity, extending to group-level reporting for parent companies. It should include material impacts, risks, and opportunities in both the direct and indirect business relationships across its value chain. This inclusion is based on due diligence and materiality assessment outcomes, with specific ESRS requirements for value chain information. However, the organization isn't required to report on every value chain actor, only on material aspects. It should account for value chain information to provide a complete and qualitative set of data. Challenges in obtaining value chain information, especially from external entities or SMEs, may require the use of estimates or proxies, like sector-average data, to meet reporting standards. The organization's reporting on policies, actions, and targets should encompass value chain actors as relevant, and in some cases, such as GHG Scope 3 emissions, proxies can be used for compliance. The use of estimates should still ensure the information meets the qualitative characteristics set by the standard.",,
6. Time horizons,"The organization's sustainability statement should have the same reporting period as its financial statements. It needs to establish links between past and future information for clarity. A base year acts as a reference point for comparing data over time. The organization should present comparative data from this base year when reporting progress towards targets. It adopts specific time intervals for reporting: the short-term matches the financial reporting period, the medium-term spans up to 5 years from the short-term's end, and the long-term exceeds 5 years. If necessary for clarity, the organization may further breakdown the long-term horizon. Definitions of these time horizons in other ESRS take precedence if they differ. The organization can adjust the medium- or long-term definitions to suit industry-specific needs, like investment duration or typical planning horizons. These definitions guide the organization's approach to identifying and managing material impacts, risks, opportunities, and target setting.",,
7. Preparation and presentation of sustainability information,"The organization must align its sustainability statement's reporting period with its financial statements and disclose comparative information for both quantitative metrics and narrative disclosures. If there are revisions in reported figures, the differences and reasons must be disclosed. In cases where adjusting comparative data is impractical, this should be stated. When ESRS requires multiple comparative periods for a metric, those requirements take precedence. The organization should disclose significant uncertainties affecting reported quantitative metrics and monetary amounts. It uses assumptions and estimates, including scenario analysis, to prepare sustainability-related information. Consistency with financial data and assumptions is required. The organization assesses material impacts, risks, and opportunities for the entire consolidated group and must address any significant differences in material impacts between the group and its subsidiaries. It is not required to disclose classified or sensitive information but must ensure the overall relevance of disclosures is not impaired. When reporting on opportunities, the disclosure should be descriptive and consider materiality, including whether the opportunity is part of the general strategy and the appropriateness of including quantitative measures.",,
8. Structure of the sustainability statement,"The organization's sustainability statement, part of its management report, is structured as per Directive 2013/34/EU. This statement should clearly distinguish between ESRS-required information and other content in the management report. It should be both human-readable and machine-readable. All required ESRS disclosures, except where information is incorporated by reference, must be included in this dedicated section. The statement must also contain disclosures as per Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, clearly identifiable within the environmental section. If the organization includes additional disclosures from other legislation or sustainability standards, these should be clearly identified and meet the standard's qualitative requirements. The sustainability statement is structured into four parts: general, environmental, social, and governance information. Sector-specific disclosures are grouped by reporting area and sustainability topic, presented with corresponding ESRS disclosures. Any material entity-specific disclosures developed should be reported alongside relevant sector-agnostic and sector-specific disclosures.",,
9. Linkages with other parts of corporate reporting and connected information,"The organization must present information in its sustainability statement that clearly connects different parts of the statement and links it with other corporate reporting elements. Information prescribed by ESRS Disclosure Requirements can be incorporated by reference from various parts of the corporate reporting, under specific conditions like being clearly identified, published simultaneously, and meeting the same language and assurance levels as the sustainability statement. The same applies to information from the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) reports, ensuring it aligns with ESRS preparation standards. Cohesiveness in reporting is crucial, and the organization should describe relationships between different information pieces, connecting governance, strategy, risk management, metrics, and targets. It should also link monetary amounts and other quantitative data in the sustainability statement with corresponding information in the financial statements, explaining the relationship and providing references or reconciliations where necessary. Consistency in significant data assumptions and qualitative information between the sustainability statement and financial statements is required, with explanations for any inconsistencies. Topical and sector-specific ESRS may require additional reconciliations or consistency illustrations for specific disclosures.",,
10. Transitional provisions,"The organization's approach to sustainability reporting under ESRS is expected to evolve, reducing the need for entity-specific disclosures over time, especially with the adoption of sector-specific standards. Initially, it can use transitional measures for the first three annual sustainability statements, which include incorporating prior entity-specific disclosures that align with the standard's qualitative characteristics and complementing disclosures with additional material relevant to its sector. In these first three years, if complete information on the upstream and downstream value chain isn't available, the organization should explain its efforts to obtain this information and future plans to acquire it. During this period, reporting on policies, actions, and targets may be limited to in-house data and publicly available information, with some flexibility in including value chain information. From the fourth year, comprehensive upstream and downstream value chain information is required, with considerations for SMEs in the value chain. The first application of the standard exempts the organization from presenting comparative information in the first year. Phase-in provisions are listed in the standard, indicating which requirements can be omitted or are not applicable in the initial years of sustainability statement preparation under ESRS.",,
Appendix A: Application Requirements,"The organization's entity-specific disclosures in its sustainability statement should clearly convey its environmental, social, and governance impacts, risks, and opportunities. These disclosures must adhere to the qualitative characteristics outlined in the standard and encompass material information across governance, strategy, impact management, and metrics and targets. The organization should select performance metrics that effectively represent its impact on people and the environment, ensure reliability, and provide necessary context for interpretation. Comparability with other entities and over time is essential, utilizing frameworks and standards for maximal comparability. For the initial three years, the organization may face challenges in gathering complete upstream and downstream value chain information, and is allowed to limit this to in-house and publicly available data. Post this period, comprehensive value chain information becomes mandatory. The organization is also expected to engage in dialogue with affected stakeholders and experts to inform its materiality assessment, which involves understanding context, identifying impacts, and assessing their materiality based on scale, scope, and irremediable character. Risks and opportunities assessment starts with identifying impacts on the organization's financial position and performance, considering dependencies on natural and social resources. The materiality of these risks and opportunities is determined by their likelihood and potential financial impact. The organization must report on material sustainability matters identified in its assessment, using the topical ESRS list as a guide, and develop additional entity-specific disclosures as needed. If collecting complete value chain information is not feasible, reasonable estimates based on available data are acceptable. Cross-referencing policies across environmental and social disclosures is allowed for consolidated presentation.",,
Appendix B: Qualitative characteristics of information,"The organization's sustainability disclosures should enable users to understand its environmental, social, and governance impacts, risks, and opportunities. These disclosures must be relevant, having predictive and confirmatory value, and should be material, focusing on significant information specific to the entity. To be useful, the information needs to be complete, neutral, and accurate. Completeness involves presenting all material information, including how the organization responds to impacts, risks, and opportunities. Neutrality requires unbiased reporting, covering both positive and negative aspects, supported by prudence. Accuracy means presenting information free from material error and clarifying estimates' limitations. Comparability of sustainability information is crucial, allowing for comparisons with previous periods and other organizations, but it doesn't require uniformity. Consistency in approaches and methods over time aids in comparability. Verifiability gives users confidence in the information's completeness, neutrality, and accuracy. Sustainability information should be understandable, clear, concise, and coherent, avoiding generic content and unnecessary duplication. It should provide context and connections between related information and be aligned with the financial statements, especially regarding sustainability-related risks and opportunities. The organization must ensure technical clarity, define units of measure, and avoid excessive technicality and abbreviations.",,
