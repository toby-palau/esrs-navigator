Objective,"This standard tells companies what they need to share about their impact on climate change, including the good and bad effects, their efforts to reduce their impact, and how they plan to change their business to help keep global warming below 1.5°C. It also asks them to talk about the risks and opportunities from climate change, how they're dealing with them, and how all this could affect their finances. The rules match up with EU laws and focus on two main areas: reducing climate change and adjusting to it. They also look at how companies use energy and handle certain gases that can affect the climate. Other environmental and social issues related to climate change are covered in different parts of the standard.

Interactions with other ESRS,"Harmful gases like ODS, NOX, and SOX contribute to climate change and must be reported under ESRS E2. The effects of moving to a climate-friendly economy on people are covered by ESRS S1 to S4. Water and biodiversity issues related to climate change are detailed in ESRS E3 and E4. This Standard works with ESRS 1 and 2 for overall guidelines and disclosures.",,
