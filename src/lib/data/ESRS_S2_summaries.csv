Objective,"This standard tells companies to share information about how their work affects people who work for them, not just their employees but also others involved in making and selling their products or services. Companies should talk about the good and bad things that could happen to these workers, what they're doing to help, and how these issues might affect the company's money. They should also explain how they make sure workers are treated fairly and safely. If something bad happens to workers, it could hurt the company, but treating workers well could be good for business. The standard applies to all workers who are affected by the company, even if they don't work directly for it.",,
