Interaction with other ESRS,"Water and marine resources are linked to climate change, pollution, biodiversity, and recycling. Climate change can cause ocean problems like acidification and sea level rise (E1). Pollution includes water emissions and microplastics (E2). Biodiversity efforts focus on protecting oceans and freshwater (E4). Recycling and waste management help conserve water resources (E5). People and communities are impacted by changes to water and marine resources (S3). These topics are part of broader environmental and social standards (ESRS 1 and 2).",,
