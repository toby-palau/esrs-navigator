1,Objective,,"The objective of this Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statement to understand material impacts on value chain workers connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships, and its related material risks and opportunities, including:\n (a) how the undertaking affects workers in its value chain, in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;\n (b) any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts, and to address risks and opportunities;\n (c) the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities, including those related to its impacts and dependencies on workers in the value chain, and how the undertaking manages them; and\n (d) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities, including those arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on workers in the value chain.",,
2,Objective,,"In order to meet the objective, this Standard requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on value chain workers in relation to:\n (a) working conditions (for example, secure employment, working time, adequate wage, social dialogue, freedom of association, including the existence of work councils, collective bargaining, work-life balance and health and safety);\n (b) equal treatment and opportunities for all (for example, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, training and skills development, the employment and inclusion of persons with disabilities, measures against violence and harassment in the workplace, and diversity);\n (c) other work-related rights (for example, child labour, forced labour, adequate housing, water and sanitation and privacy).",,
3,Objective,,"This Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on value chain workers, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking. For example, negative impacts on value chain workers may disrupt the undertaking’s operations (through customers refusing to buy its products or state agencies impounding its goods) and harm its reputation. Conversely, respect for workers’ rights and active support programmes (for example through financial literacy initiatives) can bring business opportunities, such as more reliable supply or widening of the future consumer base.",,
4,Objective,,"This Standard covers all workers in the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain who are or can be materially impacted by the undertaking, including impacts that are connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships. This includes all workers who are not included in the scope of “own workforce” (“own workforce” includes employees, individual contractors, i.e., self- employed workers, and workers provided by third party undertakings primarily engaged in ‘employment activities’). Own workforce is covered in ESRS S1 Own workforce. See AR 3 for examples of what is included in the scope of this Standard.",,
AR1,Objective,Application Requirements,"In addition to the issues listed in paragraph 2, the undertaking may also consider disclosing information about other issues relevant to a material impact for a shorter period of time, for instance initiatives regarding the health and safety of value chain workers during a pandemic",,
AR2,Objective,Application Requirements,"The overview of social and human rights matters provided in paragraph 2 is not meant to imply that all of these issues should be disclosed in each Disclosure Requirement in this Standard. Rather, it provides a list of matters that the undertaking shall consider in its materiality assessment (ref. to ESRS 1 chapter 3 Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures and ESRS 2 IRO-1) related to value chain workers and, as appropriate, disclose as material impacts, risks and opportunities within the scope of this Standard.",,
AR3,Objective,Application Requirements,"Examples of workers that fall within the scope of this Standard are:\n (a) workers of outsourced services working in the workplace of the undertaking (e.g., third party catering or security workers);\n (b) workers of a supplier contracted by the undertaking who work on the supplier’s premises using the supplier’s work methods;\n (c) workers for a ‘downstream’ entity which purchases goods or services from the undertaking;\n (d) workers of an equipment supplier to the undertaking who, at a workplace controlled by the undertaking, perform regular maintenance on the supplier’s equipment (e.g., 10 photocopier) as stipulated in the contract between the equipment supplier and the undertaking; and\n (e) workers deeper in the supply chain who are extracting commodities that are then processed into components that go in the undertaking’s products.",,

In addition, the undertaking shall provide the following information:\n (a) a brief description of the types of value chain workers who could be materially impacted by the undertaking, including impacts that connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships, and specify whether they are:\n (ai) workers working on the undertaking site but who are not part of own workforce, i.e., who are not self-employed workers or workers provided by third party undertakings primarily engaged in employment activities (covered through ESRS S1);\n (aii) workers working for entities in the undertaking’s upstream value chain (e.g., those involved in the extraction of metals or minerals or harvesting of commodities, in refining, manufacturing or other forms of processing);\n (aiii) workers working for entities in the undertaking’s downstream value chain (e.g., those involved in the activities of logistics or distribution providers, franchisees, retailers);\n (aiv) workers working in the operations of a joint venture or special purpose vehicle involving the reporting undertaking;\n (av) workers who (within the prior categories or additionally) are particularly vulnerable to negative impacts whether due to their inherent characteristics or to the particular context, such as trade unionists, migrant workers, home workers, women or young workers.\n (b) any geographies, at country level or other levels, or commodities for which there is a significant risk of child labour, or of forced labour or compulsory labour, among workers in the undertaking’s value chain1 ;\n (c) in the case of material negative impacts, whether they are either (i) widespread or systemic in contexts where the undertaking operates or has sourcing or other business relationships (e.g., child labour or forced labour in particular commodity supply chains in specific countries or regions), or (ii) related to individual incidents (e.g., an industrial accident or an oil spill) or to specific business relationships. This includes consideration of impacts on value chain workers that may arise from the transition to greener and climate-neutral operations. Potential impacts include impacts associated with innovation and restructuring, closure of mines, increased mining of minerals needed for the transition to a sustainable economy, and solar panel production;\n (d) in the case of material positive impacts, a brief description of the activities that result in the positive impacts (e.g., updated purchasing practices, capacity-building to supply chain workers), including providing opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling in the context of a ‘just transition’, and the types of value chain workers that are positively affected or could be positively affected; the undertaking may also disclose whether the positive impacts occur in specific countries or regions; and\n (e) any material risks and opportunities for the undertaking arising from impacts and dependencies on value chain workers.",,semi-narrative
12,"Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model",,"In describing the main types of value chain workers who are or could be negatively affected, based on the materiality assessment set out in ESRS 2 IRO-1, the undertaking shall disclose whether and how it has developed an understanding of how workers with particular characteristics, those working in particular contexts, or those undertaking particular activities may be at greater risk of harm.",,narrative
13,"Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model",,"The undertaking shall disclose which, if any, of its material risks and opportunities arising from impacts and dependencies on its value chain workers relate to specific groups of value chain workers (for example, particular age groups, workers in a particular factory or country) rather than to all of the value chain workers.",,narrative
AR6,"Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model",Application Requirements,"Impacts on value chain workers can originate in the undertaking’s strategy or business model in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking’s value proposition (such as providing lowest cost products or services, or high-speed delivery, in ways that put pressure on labour rights in the upstream and downstream value chains), its value chain (such as relying on commodities of unclear provenance, without visibility on impacts on workers), or its cost structure and the revenue model (e.g. shifting inventory risk to suppliers, with knock-on effects on the labour rights of their workers).",,
AR7,"Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model",Application Requirements,"Impacts on value chain workers that originate in the strategy or the business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, undertakings that rely on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefits may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major supply chain breakdowns. Another example is where selling goods premised on cheapest prices for customers create operational risks as suppliers under extreme price pressure may sub-contract production, leading to lower quality, and a longer, less transparent, and less controllable supply chain. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of low-skilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections for them are also increasing with media backlash and consumer preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.",,
AR8,"Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model",Application Requirements,"Examples of particular characteristics of value chain workers that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 12 relate to young workers that may be more susceptible to impacts on their physical and mental development, or women workers in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrant workers in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some workers, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to undertake may put them at risk (e.g., workers required to handle chemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid workers who are on “zero hours” contracts).",,
AR9,"Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model",Application Requirements,"With regard to paragraph 13, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking’s dependency on value chain workers where low likelihood but high impact events may trigger financial effects; for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe health impacts on workers at all stages of the value chain resulting in major disruptions to production and distribution. Other examples of risk related to the undertaking’s dependency on value chain workers include a shortage in skilled workers or political decisions or legislation affecting value chain workers working for logistics providers. For example, if some workers in the undertaking’s value chain are at risk of forced labour, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour.",,

AR7,Appendix A: Application Requirements,"Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 - Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model","Impacts on value chain workers that originate in the strategy or the business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, undertakings that rely on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefits may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major supply chain breakdowns. Another example is where selling goods premised on cheapest prices for customers create operational risks as suppliers under extreme price pressure may sub-contract production, leading to lower quality, and a longer, less transparent, and less controllable supply chain. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of low-skilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections for them are also increasing with media backlash and consumer preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.",,

Other examples of risk related to the undertaking’s dependency on value chain workers include a shortage in skilled workers or political decisions or legislation affecting value chain workers working for logistics providers.
